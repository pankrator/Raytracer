# Raytracer
Distributed raytracer with ability to render scene with n number of machines on the network

Currently there is only one default scene. Later scene will be loaded from a file.

#Get it started
  * Export jar file from Eclipse for example.
  * Open Command window or Terminal and type ``java -jar renderer.jar server``. This will start the server.
  * In order to start a client open another Command window or Terminal and type ``java -jar renderer.jar client SERVER's IP``. In the place of SERVER's IP type IP of the machine that server is running.
